# BrickSpace

# Why BrickSpace was made?
BrickSpace was a requested project by a subject matter expert  and they requested us to make a Vr game that would allow individuaals who have trouble communicating and collaborating to build structures together in a virtual environment.
This game was and is supposed to incentivise players to communicate, plan and collaborate to build a structure together.
