# Robo-Arm

This project involved designing and programming a robotic arm capable of autonomously identifying, picking, and sorting objects based on color and shape.

## System Architecture
- **Vision System**: Uses a ZED Stereo Camera and OpenCV to detect object coordinates in 3D space.
- **Control System**: Inverse kinematics algorithms implemented in Python to control the arm's servo motors.
- **Hardware**: Custom 3D printed parts designed in SolidWorks and a custom PCB for power distribution.

## My Role
I was responsible for the **Computer Vision** pipeline and the **PCB Design** for the motor controllers.
