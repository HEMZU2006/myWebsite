# Solar Nexus

**Solar Nexus** is a space exploration game built in Unity. Players pilot a customizable ship through a procedurally generated solar system, managing fuel and resources while avoiding hazards.

## Gameplay Loop
1.  **Explore**: Discover new planets and asteroid belts.
2.  **Gather**: Mine resources from asteroids.
3.  **Upgrade**: Use resources to improve ship speed, cargo capacity, and shields.

## Development
This was a solo project to learn the intricacies of Unity's physics engine and C# scripting. I implemented a custom gravity system to simulate orbital mechanics.
